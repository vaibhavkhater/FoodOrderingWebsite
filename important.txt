1. Change the datasource db in application.properties file according to your db.

Conventions:
1. Using camelCase for variable names and PascalCase for class names.

Possible improvements:
1. Now for users of database to have unique ids, I am not gonna set Id during initialization. But when it is sent to db, I am then gonna set it.


Requires urgent changes:
1. Add DateTime for order placed and order delivered.
2. Move addressId from order to cart
3. Adding transaction datetime for transaction table.
